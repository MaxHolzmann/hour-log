# Hour Log

Hour Log is a fullstack web application that utilizies React, TailwindCSS, Next.JS, NextAuth, MongoDB & DaisyUI.

Hour Log came to me as an idea when I held a position that required me to track my own hours. My mind naturally wanted to code a solution, and thus Hour Log was born! I've found it incredibly useful to reduce the mental math, as I utilized an "export" feature that allows you to pick through a range of dates and export a PDF report to send to your employer.
